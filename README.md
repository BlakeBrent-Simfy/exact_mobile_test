Create an Android application that caters for both Functions 1 and 2 as listed below:

Good Luck! FUNCTION 1
1. Display the following images below each other
http://placehold.it/4096x4096&text=Track1
http://placehold.it/4096x4096&text=Track2
http://placehold.it/4096x4096&text=Track3
http://placehold.it/4096x4096&text=Track4
http://placehold.it/4096x4096&text=Track5
http://placehold.it/4096x4096&text=Track6
http://placehold.it/4096x4096&text=Track7
http://placehold.it/4096x4096&text=Track8
http://placehold.it/4096x4096&text=Track9
http://placehold.it/4096x4096&text=Track10
2. Each image should have a unique DESCRIPTION to its right, this description should be longer than 1 line, however, only displaying 1 line of the content
3. Each image should be clickable (Only the image, NOT the description)
4. When clicking an image, a popup should appear which displays a unique HEADING and the FULL DESCRIPTION from point 1
5. The popup should also contain 2 buttons, BUTTON 1 = "Play" & BUTTON 2 = "Close"
6. Selecting BUTTON 1 should play a unique sound depending on the image selected. Selecting BUTTON 2 should dismiss the popup
BONUS
If I disable my internet access, the application should behave accordingly
FUNCTION 2
1. Allow for the user to enter their [NAME], as well as a button to SUBMIT
2. When the user selects submit, a new screen should appear which displays the following: TEXTVIEW = "Welcome [NAME]" as well as 2 BUTTONS
3. Selecting the first button should take the user back to the initial screen where they can re-enter their name
4. Selecting the second button should simply close the application
5. If I have already entered my name, and am re-launching the application, the first screen should be bypassed and the second screen should be shown immediately
6. Additionally, in the scenario of point 5, the TEXTVIEW should instead display: "Welcome [NAME], thanks for returning, we hope you enjoy your stay!"
